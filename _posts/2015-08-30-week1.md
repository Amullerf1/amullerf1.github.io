I enrolled in this course because a friend of mine told me that he learned an incredible amount of crucial information in this course and it was the perfect course to have in your last or previous to last semester because it forces you to review older topics that we learned in our first or second year as Computer Science students. So far I have no idea if this will be true or not but I am glad that I entered this course, not for the material that will be covered, but because of Professor Downing. I do not know him yet, but he said during the first class that no recruiter will care how fast you graduated, or how many courses you took during the summer, all they care about is where have you worked and what projects outside of school you have done, so donâ€™t take summer classes, get a job. No other teacher had ever told me this and it made sense. The only thing that will matter to them is what can I do and what have I done in the industry.
I realized that this was going to be a difficult class but that all the topics, projects and tests would help me in the real world once I graduate this coming May. I am really excited to be in this course and I know that I will learn a lot about what to do after graduating throughout this course.

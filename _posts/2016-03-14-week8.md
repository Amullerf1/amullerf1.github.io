1. What did you do this past week?
Last week (or the week of March 14) we saw te specifications of the next project which is an imitation of imdb. We are supposed to build our own website (hosted on Rackspace), be able to read and display an API from another website and send our own API when another site requests it. Or I think that is what we have to do. Computer Science projects usually involve a lot of new tools and concepts that you don’t necessarily learn in class and you are supposed to learn them on your own. And this project is taking that concept to the extreme. I have no idea what to do so I guess I will be hitting the tutorials for a while.

2. What's in your way?
Lack of knowledge about everything, AngularJS, Flask, Boostrap, Docker, Catrina, etc. I have never used any of these tools so I will have to learn them all before starting the project. Hopefully some of my partners will know how to use some tools in order to save time. If not we will just split them and have each one of us focus on a tool.

3. What will you do next week?
Next week I will go over at least one tutorial for each service and focus on one or two so that I am able to help my team the most with those parts.

Tip of the Week: It is easy to feel overwhelmed when starting new project, especially if there are things that you have never worked with. Don’t stress about it and look up some tutorials.

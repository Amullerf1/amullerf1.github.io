Week 2

If you are like me then this is the first class that you have used GitHub and the first time you use it feels like drinking from a fire hose. I opened the first project and started looking at the steps to make the project worked and I started panicking because I couldn’t get past the first three steps by myself. It was humiliating. I saw posts on Piazza from other people that where almost done with the project almost immediately and I started doubting my abilities as a Computer Science student. I know I am not the brightest programmer in my class but I consider myself a smart person and it was horrible failing in the first steps. I have had projects where I had trouble, but not in the first three steps of a 39 step list.

Thankfully I have acquired the skill to look up everything on the web and to accept when I do not know what I am doing. I went through four or five GitHub tutorials for Beginners until I found one that I understood and that worked for me. Right now I am almost finishing the first project and I am relieved to say that I am getting the hang of it. So don’t worry if you are like me and this class introduces you to a lot of new services that you hadn’t used before because you are not the first one and I am pretty sure you will not be the last person that has problems with GitHub.

My weekly tip for you is that there will always be people smarter than you in the class and most of the times they are glad to help, in my class someone is sharing his notes and another guy wrote a script to make testing incredibly easy. I don’t think proud programmer gets very far in life.

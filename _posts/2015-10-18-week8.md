title: Week 9

	Professor Downing gets really excited sometimes in class and I really enjoy it when he does. First of all because I think we sounds like Gilbert Gottfried when he yells due to excitement but also because I get more and more lost the more excited he gets. He can be giving the class and I understand everything about it but then he gets to the conclusion and speaks really fast that he completely loses me. I find this pattern entertaining and it happened again this week when we were talking about the Allocator. I have no idea what he said and the end during class, but by looking at the notes later that day I was able to see what he wanted to explain. Don't be afraid if you suddenly don't understand what professor Downing is talking about, but do go home and study the notes.
	On other news this week has possibly been the worst week all semester. I just got rejected from two of my favorite companies and the worst part was that I felt that I did really well in the interviews. To make matters worse I am skipping a lot of classes in order to go to these interviews. I am getting a bunch of zeros in OOP quizzes and attendance in other classes. But I am gonna keep trying and hopefully I will get a job offer before I fail this class because of absences.

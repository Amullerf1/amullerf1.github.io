title: Week 10

1. What did you do this past week?
This past week I learned about xml, dtd and xsd formatting to help our idb project be more appealing and not just an ugly html web site. I also learned more about json objects, which was a relief since I used to see them around a lot, but I never learned them on my own because I prioritized learning other computer science topics over json and web design. 

2. What's in your way?
The fear of graduation is in my way. With only 6 or 7 weeks left the realization that I am leaving UT is setting in. And it is incredibly scary. I often have to motivate myself to keep going to class and to work on projects because by some messed up logic part of me thinks that if I don’t do it I can prolonged my stay at UT.

3. What will you do next week?
Next week I will work every single day to finish the project since I did absolutely zero work during the weekend due to round up. I am really trying hard to hang out with my friends as much as I can before graduating and living each day to the fullest.

Tip of the Week: Getting good grades and learning stuff in college is important but years from now odds are you won’t remember anything you studied but you will remember the people around you. Find the time to hang out with your friends before you or they leave and stop seeing each other for long periods of time.

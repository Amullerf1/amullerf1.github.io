title: Week 4

Being a programmer had never been a moral issue for me. I write my code until I am satisfied with it and that was it. But last week's articles really made me think about who is responsible for all the disaster that we often see in the news. Every time I see a plane disaster, the trains in Germany, or any other disaster involving technology I cannot help but wonder if the programmer was responsible, because if he or she was responsible then there is probably no way for that person to be aware of it. We all write code that gets sent somewhere around the world and it is extremely difficult to keep track of where all of our work it. Who knows where the programmer for the Mariner or Ariane is right now and maybe they never knew that it was their keystrokes that caused the error, at best they know that they worked on the team that had the error.

I know that some people, including myself, write code and don't test it fully or forget to test the most basic test cases out there. If I write code and it later causes a disaster would I be responsible for it? How would I even feel about that? These are issues that I have been pondering since reading about the Mariner and Ariane. 

Tip of the Week: Find a short book about a CS subject that won't be covered in class and carry it around campus. When every you have an hour to kill or so open it up and read it. You might learn something useful for interviews.

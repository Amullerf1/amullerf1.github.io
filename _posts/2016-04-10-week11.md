title: Week 11
---

1.	What did you do this past week? 
This past week we worked on project 3: IDB 2 which involved getting our data dynamically from an api using a JSON object and other services and displaying it on our website with angularJS and Bootstrap. The front end was my job and I found it really difficult at first since it was the first time that I worked with css, bootstrap and angularJS. But I found some tutorials, which at first were confusing, but I stuck to them and eventually they started making sense. I still don’t understand angularJS well, but I understood it enough to do the project.

2.	What's in your way? 
Not knowing what I don’t know. It occurred to me that there a ton of services like docker and catrina that not only do I not know how to use but that I don’t know that exist. I must first find out what it is that I don’t know then I can look up tutorials for these services.

3.	What will you do next week? 
I will ask my friends that know much more about CS what services and companies do they use for their projects and I will look up a tutorial of one each week. I think that if I do this constantly I will be able to know enough to no look like a complete idiot when I start working in July.

Tip of the Week: Don’t think that you can start a tutorial halfway through just because that is the part that you need. You have to see the whole tutorial from the beginning or you risk missing important information that will make your work easier.

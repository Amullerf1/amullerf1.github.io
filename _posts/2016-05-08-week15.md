What did you do this past week? 
Last week I took a break from everything and reflected on my college life so far. I started college on August 2012 and last week was my last week. A group of friends of mine got together and gave our ‘swan song’ which is when people that are retiring give advice to their colleagues, but since we are graduating we decided to do something similar. My main advice was that college is the place to learn more about yourself and it is when you can afford to make mistakes, so take advantage of college and make mistakes for the purpose of learning more about yourself.

What's in your way? 
I really don’t know what is in my way now. Everything is done and I am just waiting for the next part of my life to start. I have no idea what problems I will face and what challenged I will have to overcome, but I am looking forward to it and I cannot wait to go to Seattle and become a productive member of society.

What will you do next week? 
Study study study. That’s basically all I will be doing. I do not think I will fail any class (although one might be close) and it is the first time I am worrying about passing, so I will make sure that I graduate next week.

Tip of the Week: 
My tip of the week to join as many organizations as you can and later evaluate them and focus on 1 or 2 that you really care about. Even if you didn’t join any orgs and are about to graduate, find a club or a hobby and join it.

title: Week 14

What did you do this past week? 
This past week I presented my final project SWEet Rides and I was really nervous because the other team’s projects looked extremely well done. I didn’t know what to expect during the presentation but I was lucky enough to have a great team that did a fantastic job and surprised me with their portions of the presentation. I also saw other teams’ presentations and was surprised by how different each project was to each other even though we had to do the exact same thing with the exact same tools. 

What's in your way? 
Right now midterms and final exams are in my way to finish college. I never used to worry about failing a class, but since this is my last semester I am extremely worried about failing a class and not graduating on time. I have started studying early for this exam as well as others and I hope that I do great.

What will you do next week? 
Next week I will be studying 24/7 just to feel satisfied with my performance during finals week. I will also find friends and get together with them in order to do mockup final exam questions.

Tip of the Week: 
My tip of the week is to trust your teammates because they might surprise you in how much they can do for you. I know that we had communication problems in our team so I was unsure about what we were going to present but they surprised me and I am very glad they were in my team.

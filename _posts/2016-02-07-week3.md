title: Week 3

This week was the due date for our first project and it surprised me how many people had trouble getting the environment set on their own machine. It seemed like the hardest part of the project was not the coding, but getting coverage3, pip3, python3 and the other programs. I had the fortune of already taking one of Prof Downing's class so I already knew how to get his environment set, but a lot of my friends did not.
One of my friends told me that the project took him 16 hours and I couldn't believe it since he is a very intelligent person. Hopefully this will be a lesson learned and people will start project 2 earlier thant they did for project 1. Project 2 will be the first paired project and I am really looking forward to it. Pair projects help me a lot and I get a higher grade on it.

Tip of the Week: Talk to students who already had the professor that is teaching your class and ask them if they had trouble getting the environment working before starting. This way you can get an idea of how early you should start your projects.

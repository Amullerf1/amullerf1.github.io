title: Week 12

1.	What did you do this past week? 
Last week I didn’t work that much on Software Engineer and instead I worked on Cyber-physical systems (CPS). It’s not that I don’t like swe, but I already know a bit about sql to follow along in class without studying at home. In CPS we finally got an automated miniature car that we are supposed to program. It was a lot of fun to finally be able to hold it and start implementing the move forward and stop functionality of the car. 

2.	What's in your way? 
I think that the only thing in my way right now is the dawning fact that in exactly one month I will be graduating and joining the real world. I am trying to focus on a day to day basis and prepare for class, but it is really difficult to focus while fearing this huge step in my life.

3.	What will you do next week? 
Next week I will work on the last phase of the idb project. I will most likely focus on the search functionality and I am looking forward to implementing it. I will have to look up how to do it and ask other people on tips on how to approach it.

Tip of the Week: My tip of the week is to not always work or study in the GDC. I recently went to the architectural library and it is gorgeous. Visit other buildings around campus and study there. UT is your university, you should get to know it.
